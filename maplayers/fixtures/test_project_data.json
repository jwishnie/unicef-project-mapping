      "description": "UNICEF is the driving force that helps build a world where the rights of every child are realized. We have the global authority to influence decision-makers, and the variety of partners at grassroots level to turn the most innovative ideas into reality.  That makes us unique among world organizations, and unique among those working with the young.\r\n\r\nWe believe that nurturing and caring for children are the cornerstones of human progress.  UNICEF was created with this purpose in mind \u2013 to work with others to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child\u2019s path.  We believe that we can, together, advance the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nWe advocate for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person\u2019s future."

As part of a worldwide movement that offers neutral humanitarian care to the victims of war, the American Red Cross distinguishes itself by also aiding victims of devastating natural disasters. Over the years, the organization has expanded its services, always with the aim of preventing and relieving suffering.\r\n\r\nToday, in addition to domestic disaster relief, the American Red Cross offers compassionate services in five other areas: community services that help the needy; support and comfort for military members and their families; the collection, processing and distribution of lifesaving blood and blood products; educational programs that promote health and safety; and international relief and development programs.\r\n\r\nThe American Red Cross is where people mobilize to help their neighbors\u2014across the street, across the country, and across the world\u2014in emergencies. Each year, in communities large and small, victims of some 70,000 disasters turn to neighbors familiar and new\u2014the more than half a million volunteers and 35,000 employees of the Red Cross. Through over 700 locally supported chapters, more than 15 million people gain the skills they need to prepare for and respond to emergencies in their homes, communities and world."
